# Code Refactor - Homework

## Goal of this task

This is the first *REQUIRED* task that will grade and critique the student's attempt on code refactoring. 

The goal of this task is to showcase what skills and knowledge has been gained throughout the first three lessons of the week and turn it practical. 

**Motivation**

The motivation of this task is not just because it is required but to see how much knowledge and skills I've gained in the 9 hours of class time (excluding the study time). 

The biggest motivator is seeing things go your way and making things do what you wanted them to do.

**What problem were solved**

There were a few obvious problems such as the title of the html was 'website', so when you see it on the tab, it says 'website'. In all websites, they atleast have the name of the company and maybe additional words, usually linked with SEO keywords.

Other harder to see problems are things like, clicking onto something but it doesn't hyperlink and move you to another section of the page.

**What was learnt**

That coding requires patience and critical thinking. I've also learnt that, sometimes its best to walk away for a few minutes and come back and try to look at everything in a different perspective. It is very easy to miss some obvious flaws. 

I've also learnt that there are many pathways to achieve what you want but it is best professional practice to keep things consistent as much as possible.

Google is your bestfriend !
